# Michael Brightwood

I'm a data scientist and biologist. This is a collection of things I've done, made, and seen.

Here are some projects about the little village I call home: [Gundaroo Village Historic Slider](gundaroo67.html) / [Gundaroo Community Survey](gundaroo_survey.html)

Here's my academic website from a previous era of my work: [michaelwhitehead.net](http://michaelwhitehead.net)

Here is an article and data-viz I co-authored with my friend Nick at The Guardian: [Interactive Dog Breed Genetics](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/oct/25/interactive-see-how-your-favourite-dog-breeds-are-related-to-each-other)

Here's a story I wrote about my passion for trees: [The sexy gum: A love story](https://theconversation.com/the-sexy-gum-a-love-story-115363)

My old blog archive still gets hits on some posts, so I'm archiving it here: [Blog](blog.html)
