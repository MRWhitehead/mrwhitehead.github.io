My academic website (not so active any more): [michaelwhitehead.net](http://michaelwhitehead.net)

Some projects about the the village I call home: [Gundaroo Village Historic Slider](gundaroo67.html), [Gundaroo Community Survey](gundaroo_survey.html)

And an article and data-viz I co-authored for The Guardian: [Interactive Dog Breed Genetics](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/oct/25/interactive-see-how-your-favourite-dog-breeds-are-related-to-each-other)
