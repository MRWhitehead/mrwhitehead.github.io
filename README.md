I have a website that I don't update very much any more: [michaelwhitehead.net](http://michaelwhitehead.net)
Here's a little look at the village I live in through time: [Gundaroo Village Historic Slider](gundaroo67.html)
And an article and data-viz I co-authored for The Guardian- [Interactive Dog Breed Genetics](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/oct/25/interactive-see-how-your-favourite-dog-breeds-are-related-to-each-other)
