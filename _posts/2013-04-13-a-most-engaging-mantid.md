Recently, I was fortunate enough to spend eight days in <a title="Ndumo Game Reserve" href="http://goo.gl/maps/jj0pI" target="_blank">Ndumo Game Reserve</a>, where for several hours a day I remained perched above clusters of large flowers smelling rather like a long-drop toilet. Tagging along as help on a study of <i>Stapelia gigantea </i>promised to be a chance to see a new South African biome and the wonderful creatures that come along with it.

Driving to and from the field site every day we would <a title="encounter giraffe" href="http://instagram.com/p/XeynaoLXCq/" target="_blank">encounter giraffe</a>, wildebeest, nyala, impala and warthogs going about their daily activities. At dusk <a title="we’d sit in a bird hide" href="http://instagram.com/p/XkVzuxrXPV/" target="_blank">we’d sit in a bird hide</a>, count waterfowl and watch crocodiles cruise on by. Our nights were serenaded by the wailing bush baby, the guttural grunting of wildebeest, the booming-bass of hippos and occasionally the manic whinny of a hyena, while the porch light drew in a bewildering buffet of <a title="invertebrate curiosity" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwhitehead/8627876299/in/photostream/lightbox/" target="_blank">invertebrate curiosity</a>.

But perhaps the most endearing animal found all trip was one of the most captivating mantids I have ever seen. She is a cryptically coloured <i>Hymenopodidae</i>, belonging to the same subfamily as the spectacular orchid mantis. Unlike other mantids I have encountered she is very easy to handle and shows no desire to flee the hand or captivity. She is a voracious feeder and any moth or fly introduced to her enclosure scarcely lasts 5 minutes before straying too close to her raptorial forelimbs. On her second night in our field accommodation she had already laid a small ootheca.

<p style="text-align:left;">She also displays a charming and unusual shadow boxing routine complete with weaving, jabs and feints.</p>

Edit: I have since learned that she belongs to genus <em>Oxypilus, </em>a group of mantids called "Boxer mantis", for reasons made obvious in this video. (Thanks <a title="Mantidboy" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/invertsfromhell/" target="_blank">Mantidboy</a> for the ID).

<i>The above video was shot with a Canon 500D, Canon 100mm f/2.8 macro in an improvised stove-top studio. A piece of white paper provided the background, the camera was stabilized on a bag of rice. This left my hands free to experiment with the lighting, provided by a cheap head torch. </i>
