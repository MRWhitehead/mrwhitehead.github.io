<em><a href="http://theterritories.com.au/">The Territories</a> </em>is Heath Killen's new project. The site blends stories of Australia's natural and cultural history under a unique aesthetic. I encourage you to check it out.

I was happy to make a recent contribution to <em>The Territories, </em>a story and photo gallery about Australia's abundance of deceptive orchids:

<a href="http://theterritories.com.au/sex-lies-and-pollination/">"Sex, Lies and Pollination"</a>

<em>Rather than luring its pollinator with the promise of food this flower uses an equally, if not more, powerful motivator: sex. Undetectable to human senses, the orchid’s advertisement is a precise chemical mimicry of a female wasp’s sex pheromone. This is targeted marketing at its finest, as the use of a signature sex pheromone ensures that the orchid attracts only males of a specific species of wasp.</em>
