The Great Western Woodlands (GWW) form the largest tracts of temperate woodlands left on Earth. They hold approximately 30% of Australia's Eucalypt species, and close to 20% of Australia's plant species overall. This is truly an overlooked gem of Australian biodiversity. Last Spring I was lucky enough to visit for my work on pollination in our native plants.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/img_2273-5.jpg" alt="IMG_2273-5" width="5239" height="2947" />

My target there was <em>Eremophila</em>, a genus of approximately 250 species largely confined to arid and semi-arid Australia. The GWW represents one of the centres of diversity for the genus, and so I chose it as a likely spot to set up a new study contrasting bird and insect pollination.

<figure class="wp-caption"><img class="  wp-image-831 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/img_2191-1.jpg" alt="IMG_2191-1" width="479" height="719" /> <em>Eremophila alternifolia </em>was one of about 15 <em>Eremophilas </em>I saw flowering despite the drier than average conditions.</figure>

I was joined by perhaps the best kind of field assistant: a trained and accomplished professional ecologist who also happens to be my beautiful wife. After driving 2800km from Melbourne to field sites near Norseman, Western Australia, we spent a little under two weeks observing pollinators, surveying and mapping populations of plants, and collecting samples for population genetics.

<figure class="wp-caption"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-841" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/img_2019-7.jpg" alt="IMG_2019-7" width="5472" height="3078" /> One of the many viewpoints south of the Nullarbor Plain.</figure>

I left in awe of the scale of these woodlands, in love with the peace and isolation they offer, and a bit concerned over their insecure future. Fully 60% of the GWW is tenured "unallocated Crown land", unmanaged and open access. With more visitors, and more appreciation of the value of these vast woodlands, I hope we can find a way to secure more of it into ongoing reserve for future generations.

As predicted from the small, violet flowers, <em>Eremophila scoparia </em>was visited by a host of native bees.

The very long style with pollen-presenter is suggestive of adaptation to birds, but mammals might not be out of the question.</figure>

I made us walk 10km to collect camp gear following a single poor decision.</figure>

Stay tuned as research results emerge. The study should tell us about the way pollen moves under bee and bird pollination, and how those fine scale patterns play out on a grand landscape level.
