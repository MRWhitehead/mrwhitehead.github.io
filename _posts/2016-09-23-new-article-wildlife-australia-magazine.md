Seduction. Pollination. Deception.

I recently wrote an article for <em>Wildlife Australia</em> about Australian sexually deceptive orchids, their evolutionary biology, and historical and current research about them. You can download and read the article here: <a title="sexual-swindlers-michael-whitehead-wam-spring-2016" href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexual-swindlers-michael-whitehead-wam-spring-2016.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>. Thanks to Carol Booth for her collaboration and editorial guidance.

The latest of Australia's sexually deceptive orchids that I have seen (below) are <em>Caleana major, </em>the Flying Duck orchid (left), and a spider orchid <em>Caladenia clavigera (</em>right<em>). </em>Both were photographed last week in Brisbane Ranges NP, Victoria.

Flowering this year is one of the best seasons of recent times both east and west of the country. So if you're in Australia, don't miss the chance to get out bush and enjoy it.
