I must have been around six or seven years old, but I vividly remember being captivated by Densey's work on late 80's Burke's Backyard. Her subjects were mostly invertebrates, the natural history of which she brought to life with superb macro and timelapse filmography. (For classic Densey and awesome 80's music <a href="https://youtu.be/szS8XskEe0g">check out this vid</a> about cicadas). It might not even be too far-fetched to draw a direct line from Densey's work—  some of my earliest recollections of a natural history fascination—to my life and work now, preoccupied with the flowers and insects she revealed to me so long ago.

Clyne's clips of flowers blooming in timelapse made a particular impression on me. In a moment of frustration with a bored and annoying child, I remember Mum sending me into the backyard to wait for a flower to bloom. Soaked in the false impressions of timelapse filmography, I stood staring at a <em>Callistemon</em> for what felt an age before finally conceding defeat and coming back indoors.

In the last couple of years I had the desire and embryonic plan to go and visit her, knowing she was getting on, wanting to meet her and tell her the impression she made on me, and perhaps write up an interview to share her experience and wisdom with others. But I never got around to prioritising it, and now that opportunity is gone.

From the tiniest, dankest little crevices in the bottom of my heart; thanks Densey.
