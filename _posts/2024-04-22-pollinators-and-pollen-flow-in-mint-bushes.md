<p>Although my research is on indefinite/terminal hiaitus, I am happy to see my last seminar remains online. It is certainly far from my best - given under circumstances of COVID lockdown, and after I had left my last academic post - but at least there's a record for anyone interested in <em>Prostanthera </em>pollination.</p>

<p>The seminar was given as part of the <a href="https://apsvic.org.au/fjc-rogers-seminar-2020">special Prostanthera series of events held by the Australian Plants Society Victoria</a>.</p>
